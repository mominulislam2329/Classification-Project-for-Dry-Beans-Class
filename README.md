## Use of Multi Class Classification Algorithms for Dry Beans Class

Dry bean cultivation is practiced in Turkey and Asian countries usually in the form of populations containing
mixed species of seeds. As different populations containing different genotypes are cultivated, the final products
contain different species of seeds. Finally, when the dry bean seeds obtained from population cultivation are
released to the market without being separated by species, the market value decreases immensely. Because of the
wide range of genetic diversity of dry bean, seed classification is essential for marketing and production. With an
aim for establishing a sustainable agricultural system, Koklu et al. provided methods for obtaining uniform seed
varieties from crop production. Additionally, Koklu et al. created distinct multiclass classification algorithms for
seven different registered varieties of dry beans with comparable characteristics to achieve consistent seed
categorization which also addressed the problems of market value.

Our aim of this project to explore the potential of the various learning methods and give a recommendation on
which type of algorithm we should further develop for the task of sorting white beans. We are expected to develop
an automated method that predicts the value of a harvest from a ‘population cultivation’ from a single farm that
has been presented at market. Since each of the beans has a different value at market the cost of an error depends
on the actual type of white bean and what it is predicted class. Additionally, we will provide some measure of our
predictive systems.
